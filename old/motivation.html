          You can have extreme motivation that you are absolutely sure is going to make you get things done in a very, very short amount of time. And then you have this other, deeper motivation that says, 'Look, I know there are other people who are not like me, and I don't want to be a disappointment to them. I've been waiting all my life for this. I've worked so hard for it. And I'm going to do it if I have to do it alone.' That's when you know that you need to get off and take a break.
<br>
This might sound obvious, but it bears repeating. We want to be rewarded for the efforts we put in. If we get rewarded for something only if we did it, then there is no incentive to put in hard work and make improvements, but rather there is a lot of incentive to get good grades and to get into the most prestigious and powerful universities.
<br><br>
What's the key to motivation?
<br>
Well, if I had to give the key to motivation, it would be:
<br>
Focus on doing what is important to you and don't be afraid to fail.
<br>
If you focus on the important things in life, you're much more likely to be able to concentrate on your main goal in life, and that will be to make something important to you or to do something important to you.
<br>
And, so you may feel like your main goal is to be a doctor or to be a CEO or to be a great actor or to be a great athlete or something like that. You are focusing on the right things. But it's also really important, I think, to focus on the little things, because when you concentrate on the things that are important to you, you can then focus on more of the little things, because you can say, 'Well, OK, I have to get all these things right because if I don't, this isn't going to get done and that's not going to happen.' And then I'm more motivated to focus on the big things because then I can do them. You focus on the small things and you can just concentrate on those.
<br>
Procrastination is your worst enemy. The more you put off a goal, the more likely you are to never actually achieve it.
<br>
What does this have to do with self-discipline? When you make a choice, your brain uses your willpower. But it also activates the brain's executive functioning centers. These are the areas in the brain that are responsible for making decisions, managing your time and your goals, and putting off gratification for future rewards.

If your goal is to lose 10 pounds by Christmas, willpower is the reason you can't stop yourself from eating junk food or getting drunk on New Year's Eve. These activities are in part an attempt to use your willpower. But you'll only succeed if your executive functioning centers work because you'll end up using willpower in ways that are counterproductive to your goal.

                <li>Processing</li>

It's no wonder that people with ADHD are often more focused than their non-ADHD peers. The ADHD brain is wired to use focus as first aid, to deal with the most difficult problems. We're wired to use focus to get things done, to avoid distractions. So it makes sense that a person with ADHD is more focused.
<br>
So how do you use focus to achieve your goals?
<br><br>
Here are some tips:
<br>
Don't let the fear of failure inhibit your ability to succeed. 
          <br>
          Do what it takes to get the most out of yourself.
<br>
          Take a deep breath.
          <br>

          This one is simple but it takes practice. It's also something that I have to remind myself of time and again, as a reminder that I am still breathing. The most effective breathing techniques involve using your body. If you are sitting in front of a computer then take a deep breath and inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. If you're writing then take a deep breath through your nose and exhale through your mouth. If you're walking then take a deep breath through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
<br>
          

          Just focus on the feeling of the breath.
<br>
          
As you may remember, this all started with a discussion around motivation.
So I had a question for you. It comes from a friend of mine named Michael. "Have you ever thought about how you can use the same techniques to get people to become more active (even if they already are) without them ever really trying?" I love his question and I think it hits on the heart of motivation, especially as it pertains to getting people to get up and do something.
<br>
I've always wondered how you might get someone to try new activities. I have lots of friends who are a little lazy, and I've seen them get into lots of bad habits without really trying. So I decided to see how we could get people to try new activities that they might never otherwise attempt if they were not pushed.
<br><br>
If you reading this right now, you're god-damn crazy. This whole article is GPT2 generated and I have not spent a f****** minute editing it. So it's either tech getting so good we can't properly tell, or you assumed my writing is that bad. In either case, that's it. See you around!
